			<h1>About Us</h1>
			</header>
        <p> <i> “You can have your book and read it too!” <br> [or another slogan as soon as someone thinks of a better one ;) ] </i></p>
		<p><b>What is BookIt?</b><br>BookIt is a free textbook resale service created by students, for students. You can sell your old textbooks to students on your campus, or you can browse used books that students from your school are selling. </p>
		<br>
		<p><b>Why was BookIt created?</b><br>BookIt was created by a team of students at the University of Washington Bothell. Just like you, we were tired of paying high prices for textbooks that we only used for a few weeks, only to find that their resale value was only a fraction of the original price. We wanted an easy way to communicate with other students who might need our old books and who might be able offer used books of their own. </p>
		<br>
		<p><b>How do I find a book?</b><br>First, create an account [link here] with BookIt. Then check out our homepage [link here]. You can search for a book by its full title, author’s full name, or ISBN [link here to wikipedia page explaining what ISBN is]. Please be sure to enter the full title or author’s full name exactly as it appears on the book, with correct spelling. Searching by keyword or course number is not available at this time, but we hope to add these exciting features soon!</p>
		<br>
		<p><b>I found the book I want to buy. What now?</b><br>Awesome! BookIt makes it easy for you to contact the student selling the book: just click “Contact Seller” on the book’s information page [we can update this info later once we create the book details page]. You and the seller can decide when and where you want to meet to exchange the book and the payment.</p>
		<br>
		<p><b>How do I post a book for sale?</b><br>First, create an account [link here] with BookIt. Then check out our homepage [link here]. Click the + button in corner, and enter as many details about your book as you can. Please be sure to double-check all information; if you don’t enter it correctly, buyers might not be able to find your book! You can choose the price you want for your book. Consider checking out other popular booksellers, like your campus bookstore, to make sure you price your book competitively. </p>
		<br>
		<p><b>Someone wants to buy my book. Now what?</b><br>That’s great! Communicate with the buyer to choose a time and place to meet. Consider choosing a public location on your school’s campus to ensure safety and convenience for everyone. Make sure to specify what form of payment is acceptable to you: cash, check, money order, etc. Don’t forget to bring your book to the meeting!</p>
